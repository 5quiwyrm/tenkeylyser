# Tenkeylyser

Keyboard analyser for tenkey layouts.

## Installation

Not yet ready for installation.

## Usage

Requirements:
- CLI version -> JVM installed
- REPL version -> Leiningen installed

This tool will be usable in the REPL or as a CLI tool.
The REPL version will be for people willing to read documentation and use Clojure.

The CLI tool gives you less control but can do the basic things like:
- Generating data for corpora
- Calculating layouts' stats

and the REPL version will give you full control on the tool.

For more documentation read files in `doc`.

## Contributing

This is a small project for me to learn Clojure, so I will not be maintaining this code.
This also means that I will not respond to any pull requests to merge them -- if you wish to make changes, you are free to fork this code.
