# Tenkeylyser

Keyboard analyser for tenkey layouts.

## Installation

Not yet ready for installation.

## Usage

This tool will be usable in the REPL or as a CLI tool.
The REPL version will be for people willing to read documentation and use Clojure.

The CLI tool gives you less control but can do the basic things like:
- Generating data for corpora
- Calculating layouts' stats

and the REPL version will give you full control on the tool.
