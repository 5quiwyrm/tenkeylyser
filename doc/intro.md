# Introduction to tenkeylyser

## What is tenkeylyser
Tenkeylyser is my response to the critical lack of tenkey layout analysers in the AKL community. It is also partially because of me learning Clojure that I decided to write this analyser.

My vision with writing this analyser is to kickstart the process of tenkey layout analysing and creation, and to get other, much better programmers and layout designers to collaborate and write their own layout analysers.
Thus this analyser is only the first step, not the ending. My stat definitions (or rather lack there of) are not to be treated as final and the best. Instead, I implore people to take this code and improve it.

To aid people who do not know Clojure, I will be representing the stat definitions with python, and also natural language (I added the python because natural language is quite vague).

## Code annotations
Reading the code of this project is one way to understand it, but due to the lack of comments and semi-esoteric nature of Clojure as a lisp, I will be writing complementary files to explain all functions in all files. These files will be found in the doc/comments.
